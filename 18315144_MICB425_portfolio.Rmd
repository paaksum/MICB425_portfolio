# Module 01
Reserve the first level headings (#) for the start of a new Module. This will help to organize your portfolio in an intuitive fashion.  
**Note: Please edit this template to your heart's content. This is meant to be the armature upon which you build your individual portfolio. You do not need to keep this instructive text in your final portfolio, although you do need to keep module and assignment names so we can identify what is what.**


## Module 01 portfolio check
The first of your second level headers (##) is to be used for the portfolio content checks. The Module 01 portfolio check has been built for you directly into this template, but will also be available as a stand-alone markdown document available on the MICB425 GitHub so that you know what is required in each module section in your portfolio. The completion status and comments will be filled in by the instructors during portfolio checks when your current portfolios are pulled from GitHub.

## Origins and Earth Systems

### Evidence worksheet 01 

[Whitman *et al* 1998](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC33863/)

#### Learning objectives
Describe the numerical abundance of microbial life in relation to ecology and biogeochemistry of Earth systems. 

#### General questions
* What were the main questions being asked?  
What are the primary habitats of prokaryotes? What is their abundance and total carbon content in each of the main habitats? What is the total nutrient content in these habitats?

* What were the primary methodological approaches used?  
The primary methodological approaches included estimating cellular density, volume, and carbon to estimate the number of prokaryotes in different habitats. Extrapolation of cell densities were used to determine number of subsurface prokaryotes. To determine amount of carbon in prokaryotes, cellular carbon content was assumed to be half the dry weight.

* Summarize the main results or findings.  
The main habitats of prokaryotes and their number of prokaryotes are aquatic habitats (1.2x10^29^), oceanic subsurface (3.5x10^30^), soil (2.6x10^29^), and terrestrial subsurface (0.25-2.5x10^30^). The total number of prokaryotic cells on Earth is 4-6x10^30^ and their total carbon content is 350-550Pg. They also contain 85-130Pg N and 9-14Pg P. The cellular production rate of all prokaryotes on Earth is estimated to be 1.7x10^30^ cells/yr and is highest in the open ocean.

* Do new questions arise from the results?  
What role do these large number of prokaryotes play in maintaining the ecosystem of their various habitats? What is the significance of differences in  turnover rates for prokaryotic populations in different habitats? How can methods to estimate carbon content in prokaryotes be improved upon, especially in habitats where sampling is difficult (eg. deep subsurface)?

* Were there any specific challenges or advantages in understanding the paper (*e.g.* did the authors provide sufficient background information to understand experimental logic, were methods explained adequately, were any specific assumptions made, were conclusions justified based on the evidence, were the figures or tables useful and easy to understand)?  
The paper provided a useful insight regarding the abundance of prokaryotes and their carbon content on Earth. However, the validity of the methods and sources the authors used to estimate these numbers could be more robust in that many interpretations were estimates and extrapolations.


### Problem set 01

[Whitman *et al* 1998](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC33863/)

#### Learning objectives: 
Describe the numerical abundance of microbial life in relation to the ecology and biogeochemistry of Earth systems.

#### Specific questions:
* What are the primary prokaryotic habitats on Earth and how do they vary with respect to their capacity to support life? Provide a breakdown of total cell abundance for each primary habitat from the tables provided in the text.  
The primary prokaryotic habitats on Earth are aquatic environments (cell abundance=1.2x10^29^), soils (cell abundance=2.5x10^29^), and oceanic/terrestrial subsurface (cell abundance=3.8x10^30^). 

* What is the estimated prokaryotic cell abundance in the upper 200 m of the ocean and what fraction of this biomass is represented by marine cyanobacterium including Prochlorococcus? What is the significance of this ratio with respect to carbon cycling in the ocean and the atmospheric composition of the Earth?  
The estimated prokaryotic cell abundance in the upper 200m of the ocean is 3.6x10^28^, with a density of 5x10^5^ cells/ml. The cell density of cyanobacteria is 4x10^4^ cells/ml, so the ratio of cyanobacteria over total prokaryotic cells is 8%.

* What is the difference between an autotroph, heterotroph, and a lithotroph based on information provided in the text?  
An autotroph is "self-nourishing", they fix inorganic carbon (CO2). Heterotrophs assimilate organic carbon, and lithotrophs use inorganic substrates.

* Based on information provided in the text and your knowledge of geography what is the deepest habitat capable of supporting prokaryotic life? What is the primary limiting factor at this depth?  
The deepest habitat capable of supporting prokaryotic life is deep subsurface habitats (terrestrial is 4km and marine is ~14.9km (~4km below the ocean floor. Mariana's Trench is 10.9km below sea level)). The temperature is the limiting factor at this depth. The temperature change is roughly 22 degrees Celsius per km.

* Based on information provided in the text your knowledge of geography what is the highest habitat capable of supporting prokaryotic life? What is the primary limiting factor at this height?  
The highest habitat capable of supporting prokaryotic life is 8.8km at Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. Although prokaryotes do exist in the stratosphere to some extent such as spore-forming microbes, there are no nutrients and moisture, and there is strong ionizing radiation. 

* Based on estimates of prokaryotic habitat limitation, what is the vertical distance of the Earth's biosphere measured in km?  
14.9km below sea level + 8.8km above sea level = 23.7km is the vertical distance of the Earth's bioshpere.

* How was annual cellular production of prokaryotes described in Table 7 column four determined? (Provide an example of the calculation)  
Population x turnover rate/yr = cells/yr  
3.6x10^28^ cells x 365 days / 16 turnovers = 8.2x10^29^ cells/yr

* What is the relationship between carbon content, carbon assimilation efficiency and turnover rates in the upper 200m of the ocean? Why does this vary with depth in the ocean and between terrestrial and marine habitats?  
Carbon efficiency = 20%, and 5-20fg C/cell (10^-30^pg/cell). There are 3.6x10^28^ cells.  
3.6x10^28^ cells x 20x10^-30^ Pg/cell = 0.72Pg C/marine heterotrophs  
0.72x4 = 2.88Pg/yr  
51Pg C/yr x 85% consumed = 43Pg C  
43Pg C/yr / 2.88Pg/yr = 14.9, 1 turnover every 24.5 days.  
*Numbers were pulled from multiple sources of literature, may not be an accurate calculation*
 
* How were the frequency numbers for four simultaneous mutations in shared genes determined for marine heterotrophs and marine autotrophs given an average mutation rate of 4 x 10^-7^ per DNA replication? (Provide an example of the calculation with units. Hint: cell and generation cancel out)  
(4x10^-7^)^4^=2.56x10^-26^ mutations/generation  
3.1x10^28^ cells x (365/16 turnovers/yr) = 8.2x10^29^ cells/yr  
8.2x10^29^ cells/yr x 2.56x10^-26^ mutations/generation = 2.1x10^4^ mutations/yr

* Given the large population size and high mutation rate of prokaryotic cells, what are the implications with respect to genetic diversity and adaptive potential? Are point mutations the only way in which microbial genomes diversify and adapt?  
With the large population size and high mutation rate, prokaryotic cells have a very high degree of genetic diversity and adaptive potential, as traits that were selected for from the diverse pool were proliferated quickly and in high numbers. In addition to point mutations, microbial genomes also diversify and adapt by lateral gene transfer.

* What relationships can be inferred between prokaryotic abundance, diversity, and metabolic potential based on the information provided in the text?  
The abundance and high diversity of prokaryotes coupled to their ability to rapidly proliferate means they have a high metabolic potential.

### Problem Set 2

[Falkowski, P., Fenchel, T., & Delong, E., 2008](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12004117)

#### Learning Objectives
Discuss the role of microbial diversity and formation of coupled metabolism in driving global biogeochemical cycles.

#### Specific Questions:

* What are the primary geophysical and biogeochemical processes that create and sustain condiitons for life on Earth? How do abiotic versus biotic processes vary with respect to matter and energy transformation and how are they interconnected?  
Geophysical processes include tectonic and photochemical processes, supplying substrates and removing products, allowing chemical bonds to form and break in cyclical manner. Biogeochemical reactions are based on H, C, N, O, S, and P building blocks, which are driven by microbially catalyzed redox reactions. Abiotic processes are acid-base and biotic processes are driven by redox reactions.

* Why is Earth's redox state considered an emergent property?  
Feebacks between the evolution of microbial metabolic and geochemical processes create the average redox condition of the oceans and atmosphere.

* How do reversible electron transfer reactions give rise to element and nutrient cycles at different ecological scales? What strategies do microbes use to overcome thermodynamic barriers to reversible elctron flow?  
Reversible electron transfer reactions 

* Using information provided in the text, describe how the nitrogen cycle partitions between different redox "niches" and microbial groups. Is there a relationship between the nitrogen cycle and climate change?  
Nitrogen fixation of N2 to NH4 is required in order for organisms to synthesize nucleic acids and proteins. In the presence of O2, nitrogenase is inhibited and NH4 is oxidized to NO2 then NO3. In the absence of O2, either NO2 or NO3 acts as electron acceptor to produce N2. The nitrogen cycle may cause CO2 levels to drop by converting it to organic matter.

* What is the relationship between microbial diversity and metabolic diversity and how does this relate to the discovery of new protein families from microbial community genomes?  
Microbial diversity allows for catalysis of reversible metabolic pathways. For example, nitrogen fixation is catalyzed by the extremely conserved heterodimeric enzyme complex, nitrogenase, which is inhibited by oxygen. A specific group of bacteria is required to oxidize NH4 to nitrate by oxidizing ammonia to nitrite first, before oxidization to nitrate by a different set of nitrifying bacteria.

* On what basis do the authors consider microbes the guardians of metabolism?  
Dispersal of the core planetary gene set by either vertical or horizontal gene transfer to allow a variety of organisms to guard metabolism. Environmental selection on microbial phenotype leads to evolution of boutique genes that protect the metabolic pathway. The metabolic pathway has a strong chance of surviving in at least one taxon. These taxonomic units may go extinct and evolve but the core machines survive.

### Evidence worksheet 03 

[Rockstrom *et al* 2009](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19779433)

#### Learning objectives
Evaluate human impacts on the ecology and biogeochemistry of Earth systems. 

#### General questions
* What were the main questions being asked?  
How far can human development go without causing detrimental or catastrophic effects to the environment? "What are the planetary boundaries"" that define a safe living space on Earth? How many of these boundaries have we already overstepped and what should humans do about it?

* What were the primary methodological approaches used?  
The primary methodological approaches include proposing a framework that contains "planetary boundaries", which are thresholds for each of 9 planetary systems characterized by parameters including climate change and biodiversity loss, that represent the safe operating space for humanity. These thresholds are  critical values taken from literature and are compared and assessed against current values. 

* Summarize the main results or findings.  
The 3 planetary systems of climate change (measured by carbon dioxide concentration), rate of biodiversity loss (measured by extinction rate), and nitrogen cycle (amount of N2 removed from atmosphere for human use) were found to have crossed the proposed planetary boundary. Other system boundaries such as ocean acidification and phosphorus cycle are close to being overstepped.

* Do new questions arise from the results?  
Are there other systems and processes other than the 9 proposed that are important to consider when assessing the impacts of human activity? Could some proposed systems be already overstepped if using different criteria to assess critical values? 

* Were there any specific challenges or advantages in understanding the paper (*e.g.* did the authors provide sufficient background information to understand experimental logic, were methods explained adequately, were any specific assumptions made, were conclusions justified based on the evidence, were the figures or tables useful and easy to understand)?  
The paper provided an insightful view of the state of the anthropocene and provided a good table explicitly showing how each system is assessed and which boundaries are crossed already. However, the authors noted that some boundary thresholds are "merely their best guess", and a more robust method to quantify these thresholds may result in different findings.

### Writing Assessment 01

Microbial life can easily live without us; we, however, cannot survive without the global catalysis and environmental transformations it provides. Microbes have been in existence for much longer than humans have, but with industrialization and other human activities, the human footprint on Earth's environment in our short stint is sizeable enough to alter processes that the sheer number of microbes have established for billions of years. It is the abundance of microbes that exist on Earth along with their high degree of genetic diversity that makes them necessary in sustaining life. Additionally, microbes play a major role in the nitrogen biogeochemical cycle, and with nitrogen being one of the most essential requirements for life to occur, survival without microbes would be challenging. Furthermore, the evolution of complex life such as humans would not have occurred had early microbes not orchestrated pivotal events in Earth's history such as oxygenation events.  
Microbes are very abundant on Earth. There are 4-6 x 1030 prokaryotic cells on Earth which together contain 350-550 Pg of carbon, which is 60-100% the cellular carbon found in plants (Whitman et al., 1998). This substantial number of microbes is distributed in major habitats including aquatic habitats, soil, terrestrial subsurface, as well as marine sediments (Whitman et al., 1998). In addition, they have an average cellular production rate of 1.7 x 1030 cells/yr (Whitman et al., 1998). The significance of such a presence of microbes in the world with rapid proliferation is that they have a much higher potential to accumulate mutations and thus to acquire genetic diversity (Whitman et al., 1998). This is important for global catalysis and environmental transformations because without a high degree of genetic diversity, microbes would not be able to adapt to external stimuli and stresses optimally enough to continue powering Earth's biogeochemical cycles efficiently. Some argue that humans are capable of or even obligated to take on an interventionist and managerial role to guide the Earth's ecosystem, but this would require a world of constant intervention in order to fix problems caused by previous interventions (Achenbach, 2012). If humans had developed chemical engineering technologies to command biogeochemical processes at large scale, it would likely require countless iterations to address flaws and optimize processes. It is at the very least challenging to artificially create these biogeochemical processes that microbes have shaped with their highly adaptive potential for billions of years.  
Nitrogen is the 5th most abundant element in the solar system and necessary for nucleic acid and protein synthesis, and thus to sustain life. In the atmosphere, however, it is in its inert N2 form and must be fixated to ammonium by microbes through a redox reaction (Canfield et al., 2010). Eukaryotes such as legumes and termites also fixate nitrogen, but only in symbiotic association with nitrogen-fixing prokaryotes, signifying the foundational role of prokaryotes in fixating nitrogen (Canfield et al., 2010). Human activity in the 20th century such as industrial processes, agriculture, and burning fossil fuels have all contributed to the rate of nitrogen fixation, doubling the rate and accounting for 45% of total fixed nitrogen annually produced (Canfield et al., 2010). If microbes did not fixate nitrogen and denitrify, nitrogen flux due to human activity would result in much more fixation than denitrification. In fact, the use of fertilizers in agriculture results in fertilizer wash out due to crop inefficiencies which then go on to be converted and leached into rivers and lakes as NO3-, creating hypoxic zones around the world (Canfield et al., 2010). Clearly, not only can we not live without microbe mediation of the nitrogen biogeochemical cycle, but we would also inflict pollution.  
Microbial life has been widespread since the mid-Archaean. Had early microbes not induced important checkpoints during Earth's development, complex organisms such as humans would never have arisen (Nisbet and Sleep, 2003). For example, the evolution of marine cyanobacteria predates 2.7 Ga and is evidence of global oxygenic photosynthesis (Nisbet and Sleep, 2003). In fact, a sharp oxygen spike at 2.2 Ga possibly supported the development of complex eukaryotes.  
The abundance of microbes and their high degree of genetic diversity that makes them necessary in sustaining life. They also play a major role in the nitrogen biogeochemical cycle in sustaining life. Also, the evolution of complex life would not have occurred had early microbes not shaped early Earth. With the intelligence of mankind comes consequences to our environment. Having only been in existence for a minute fraction of time compared to the age of the Earth, humans have shown they are capable of impacting the global ecosystem in yet an even shorter amount of time. Over the past few centuries, the actions of humans such as industrialization and agriculture have influenced if not resulted in climate change, biodiversity loss, and interference with the nitrogen cycle, all of which have put the Earth at risk for detrimentally irreversible change (Rockstrom et al., 2009). Microbes may not be greatly affected by these changes due to their adaptability, but humans will certainly be affected. We must recognize that microbes are essential in maintaining a viable ecosystem and be wary of the environmental impacts of our actions.

* Comment on the forces mediating divergence and cohesion in natural microbial
communities. 

#### General questions

Acquired genes promote colonization of specific regions of the intestine and new modes of interaction with host tissue, producing clincally distict variations of gastrointestinal disease.

* Do new questions arise from the results?  
Do the strain specific genes allow its mechanism of infection to differ from other strains? What are the factors (eg. environmental) that influence the rate of gene acquisition? What are some other implications of island acquisition other than ability to infect bloodstream and evade host defenses?

* Were there any specific challenges or advantages in understanding the paper (*e.g.* did the authors provide sufficient background information to understand experimental logic, were methods explained adequately, were any specific assumptions made, were conclusions justified based on the evidence, were the figures or tables useful and easy to understand)?  
Understanding this paper require several read throughs as it was heavily genetics based research. Background info and methods were explained adequately, however more informative figures would offer a better visual interpretation of the results.
